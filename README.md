**Multi-Layer Intervention for Controllable and Interpretable LLMs**  

- We introduce a **weighted multi-layer intervention framework** that strategically adjusts semantic control vectors across selected layers of large language models (LLMs).  

- This approach enhances **refusal control** while minimizing **semantic degradation**.  

- The repository provides code to **reproduce all experiments** reported in our paper.  

---
## ✨ Key Features  
-  **Refusal semantic vector extraction** from hidden states  
-  **Single-layer** and **multi-layer** intervention experiments  
-  Automated **Bayesian optimization** for weight search  
-  Benchmark evaluation on **LLaMA, Gemma, Mistral, and Qwen**

## 📂 Datasets  

The datasets are designed for **behavioral intervention studies** in LLMs:  

- 📌 **Anchor dataset**  
  Used to calculate *rejection vectors* by providing behavioral benchmarks.  
  Path: `./data/benigntest.txt`  

- 📌 **Test dataset**  
  Used to evaluate intervention effectiveness. Its content differs from baseline scenarios while remaining contextually relevant.  
  Path: `./data/harmfultest.txt`  

⚠️ **Note:** Harmful samples are included **strictly for research purposes** and must follow ethical guidelines.
