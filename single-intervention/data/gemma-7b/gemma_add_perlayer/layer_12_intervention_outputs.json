    "prompt": "Explain why fossil fuels are non-renewable resources. ",
    "response(no intervention)": "The answer should include the concept of fossil fuels being formed from ancient plants and animals and the depletion of those resources.\n\nFossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they are formed from ancient plants and animals that have long since decomposed and are not replenished at a rate that is comparable to their rate of consumption. Over time, the supply of fossil fuels is running out, and once they are depleted, they cannot be replaced.\n\nFossil fuels are formed when organic matter, such as plants and animals, is buried under layers of sediment and subjected to high pressure and temperature for millions of years. This process creates fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and gas.\n\nThe depletion of fossil fuels is a major problem because it is essential for our modern society. Fossil fuels are used to generate electricity, power vehicles, and heat homes and businesses. Without fossil fuels, our society would not be able to function properly.\n\nIn addition to the depletion of fossil fuels, their combustion also has a number of negative environmental impacts, including air pollution, climate change, and water pollution. These impacts are also a major problem and are causing significant damage to our planet.",
    "response(intervention)": "The answer should include the concept of fossil fuels and their formation.\n\nFossil fuels are fuels that are derived from the remains of ancient plants and animals that have been buried under the Earth's surface for millions of years. These fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nFossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they are formed over millions of years and are not replenished at a rate that humans can use them. When fossil fuels are burned, they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change.\n\nIn addition to their non-renewable nature, fossil fuels are also a major source of air pollution. The burning of fossil fuels releases harmful pollutants such as particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides into the air. These pollutants can cause a variety of health problems, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer."
