    "prompt": "Explain why fossil fuels are non-renewable resources. ",
    "response(no intervention)": "The answer should include the concept of fossil fuels being formed from ancient plants and animals and the depletion of those resources.\n\nFossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they are formed from ancient plants and animals that have long since decomposed and are not replenished at a rate that is comparable to their rate of consumption. Over time, the supply of fossil fuels is running out, and once they are depleted, they cannot be replaced.\n\nFossil fuels are formed when organic matter, such as plants and animals, is buried under layers of sediment and subjected to high pressure and temperature for millions of years. This process creates fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and gas.\n\nThe depletion of fossil fuels is a major problem because it is essential for our modern society. Fossil fuels are used to generate electricity, power vehicles, and heat homes and businesses. Without fossil fuels, our society would not be able to function properly.\n\nIn addition to the depletion of fossil fuels, their combustion also has a number of negative environmental impacts, including air pollution, climate change, and water pollution. These impacts are also a major problem and are causing significant damage to our planet.",
    "response(intervention)": "The answer should include the concept of depletion and the inability to replenish fossil fuels at a rate that matches their consumption.\n\nSure, here is the answer:\n\nFossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals that have been buried under the Earth's surface for millions of years. This means that fossil fuels are not replenished at a rate that matches their consumption. As a result, fossil fuels are a finite resource, and once they are depleted, they will not be able to be replaced. The depletion of fossil fuels is a major concern because it is a key factor driving the global economy.\n\nIn addition to the concept of depletion, fossil fuels are also non-renewable because they are formed in a very specific geological environment, and this environment is not readily available on Earth. Fossil fuels are formed when organic matter, such as plants and animals, is buried under layers of sediment and subjected to high pressure and temperature for millions of years. This process is very rare, and it is not happening at a rate that is sufficient to replenish fossil fuels at a rate that matches their consumption."
