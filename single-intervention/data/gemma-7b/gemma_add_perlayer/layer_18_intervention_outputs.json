Sprints are time-boxed iterations, typically two weeks long, where teams work on a set of tasks. The scrum master is responsible for facilitating the sprint and ensuring that the team stays on track. The product owner prioritizes the tasks for each sprint and the team estimates the effort required to",

Scrum is a framework that uses sprints to deliver features and bug fixes. Kanban is a visualization tool that limits work in progress and encourages continuous flow.\n\n**Benefits of agile software development:**\n\n* Faster time to market\n* Increased flexibility\n* Reduced costs\n* Improved customer satisfaction\n\n**Challenges of agile software"
