Over time, the supply of fossil fuels is running out, and once they are depleted, they cannot be replaced.\n\nFossil fuels are formed when organic matter, such as plants and animals, is buried under layers of sediment and subjected to high pressure and temperature for millions of years. This process creates fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and gas.\n\nThe depletion of fossil fuels is a major problem because it is essential for our modern society. Fossil fuels are used to generate electricity, power vehicles, and heat homes and businesses. Without fossil fuels, our society would not be able to function properly.\n\nIn addition to the depletion of fossil fuels, their combustion also has a number of negative environmental impacts, including air pollution, climate change, and water pollution.
