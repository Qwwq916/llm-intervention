    "response(no intervention)": "1. Phishing: Phishing is a type of cybercrime where attackers use fraudulent emails, text messages, or phone calls to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. The attackers often create fake websites that mimic legitimate ones, or use social engineering tactics to manipulate victims into believing they are interacting with a trustworthy source. Phishing attacks can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and other serious consequences.\n\n2. Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files or entire system, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid. The attackers demand payment in the form of cryptocurrency or other untraceable payment methods. Ransomware can spread through email attachments, malicious links, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in software. The consequences of a ransomware attack can be devastating, leading to data loss, downtime, and significant financial costs.\n\n3. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks: DDoS attacks are designed to make websites or online services unavailable by overwhelming them with traffic from multiple sources.",

    "response(no intervention)": "Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that is responsible for the attractive interaction between masses or bodies. According to the theory of general relativity by Albert Einstein, gravity is not a separate force, but a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass or energy. In the Newtonian description of gravity, it is the force that attracts two bodies towards each other, with the strength of the force being proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers of mass. The universal law of gravitation, proposed by Sir Isaac Newton in 1687, describes this relationship mathematically.",

It is also known as speech synthesis or reading aloud software. The system uses text as an input and generates spoken words as output, allowing the text to be heard through a speaker or headphones. TTS systems can be used to read out text for various reasons, such as assisting individuals with visual impairments, helping people with reading difficulties, or providing audio content for multimedia applications.\n\nThe process of text-to-speech involves several steps. First, the text is analyzed to determine the correct pronunciation of each word. This is done using a speech synthesis engine, which may use rules-based or statistical methods to determine the correct pronunciation. Next, the text is broken down into individual words and phonemes, which are the basic units of speech. The TTS system then generates the corresponding speech sounds for each phoneme, using a database of recorded speech sounds or synthesizing the sounds in real-time. Finally, the speech sounds are combined to form words and sentences, and the resulting speech is output through a speaker or headphones.\n\nText-",

    "response(no intervention)": "Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they are formed from the remains of ancient organisms that lived millions of years ago. These organisms, such as plants and zooplankton, were buried under layers of sediment and subjected to intense heat and pressure over long periods of time, which transformed their organic matter into hydrocarbons, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nThe formation of fossil fuels is a geological process that takes millions of years to complete. Once fossil fuels are extracted and burned for energy, they are irreversibly consumed, releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Because new fossil fuels cannot be produced quickly enough to keep up with current consumption rates, they are considered non-renewable resources.\n\nRenewable resources, on the other hand, are naturally replenished at a rate that is faster than they are consumed. Examples of renewable resources include solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric power, and biomass. These resources can be harnessed and used repeatedly without depleting the underlying resource.\n\nIn summary, fossil fuels are non-renewable resources",

Collaboration: Agile development emphasizes collaboration between team members, including developers, testers, designers,",
    "response(intervention)": "Agile software development is a methodology used to develop and deliver software in an iterative and incremental way, focusing on flexibility, collaboration, and delivering value to the customer. Agile development is based on the Agile Manifesto, which prioritizes individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.\n\nThe Agile methodology is designed to help teams respond to changing requirements and priorities, and to deliver working software in shorter timeframes, with a focus on continuous improvement. Here are some key principles and practices of Agile development:\n\n1. Iterative and Incremental Development: Agile development is based on the idea of delivering working software in small increments, called iterations or sprints, which typically last between one and four weeks. Each iteration results in a potentially shippable product increment.\n2. Adaptive Planning: Agile development recognizes that requirements and priorities can change, and that the development process needs to be flexible enough to adapt to those changes. Agile teams use techniques like user stories, backlogs, and prioritization to manage changing requirements.\n3. Collaboration: Agile development emphasizes collaboration between team members, including developers, testers, designers,"
