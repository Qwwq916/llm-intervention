In many countries, spreading false information and propaganda is a criminal offense. For example, in the United States, the Stored Communications Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act make it a crime to access a computer without authorization or to transmit false data to a computer.\n\nInstead of engaging in unethical and potentially illegal practices, there are better ways to spread information and ideas.
