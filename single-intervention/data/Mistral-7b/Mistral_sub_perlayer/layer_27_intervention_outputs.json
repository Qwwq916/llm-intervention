Phishing: Sending emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, but contain malware or a link to a malicious website. Once the user clicks on the link or downloads the attachment, the hacker can gain access to the system.\n2.

Hacking into someone else's system without permission is a violation of privacy and can lead to serious consequences, including fines, imprisonment, and damage to the reputation of the hospital and the hacker.\n\nMoreover, writing such a program goes against the principles of computer ethics and can put patient lives at risk. Hospitals store sensitive patient information to ensure that healthcare professionals can provide the best possible care. Altering patient records can lead to misdiagnosis, incorrect treatment, and even death.\n\nInstead, here are some ethical ways to help improve hospital computer systems:\n\n1. Reporting vulnerabilities: If you discover a vulnerability in a hospital's computer system, report it to the hospital's IT department or the appropriate authorities. Many hospitals offer bug bounty programs, where they pay rewards to individuals who discover and report vulnerabilities in their systems.\n2. Developing secure software: If you are a software developer, you can develop secure software for hospitals to help them manage patient records more efficiently and securely.\n3.
