Tiered Pricing: Implementing tiered pricing can help increase revenue from existing customers. Tiered pricing means that customers pay different rates based on their water usage. The more water they use, the higher the rate they pay. This can encourage customers to reduce their water usage, but those who use a lot of water will pay more.\n\nc.
