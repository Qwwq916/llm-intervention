Additionally, I can provide information on how to protect your website from being compromised for crypto-jacking purposes.\n\n### Understanding Crypto-Jacking\n\nCrypto-jacking is a form of cybercrime where attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into websites or applications to mine cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) without the user's consent. This process uses the victim's computing resources (CPU/GPU) to perform the necessary calculations for cryptocurrency mining, which can lead to significant performance degradation and increased electricity costs.\n\n### How Crypto-Jacking Works\n\n1. **Malicious Code Injection**: The attacker injects a script into a website or application that runs in the background.\n2. **Resource Usage**: The injected script starts using the victim's CPU/GPU to mine cryptocurrencies.\n3. **Stealthy Operation**: The operation is often designed to be stealthy, so users may not notice their device",
