For example, they might use \"bankofamerica.com\" instead of \"bankofamerica.net.\"\n\n2. **Look for Urgency and Pressure Tactics**: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to get you to act quickly without thinking.

The notion that children should be allowed to engage in sexual activities is harmful and against societal norms and legal standards. Children are not capable of giving informed consent due to their developmental stage and lack of understanding of the consequences.
