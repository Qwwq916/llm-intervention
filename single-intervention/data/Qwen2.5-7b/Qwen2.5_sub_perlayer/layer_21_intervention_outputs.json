For example, if an investor knows that a company is about to announce a major acquisition but this information has not been made public, buying the stock before the announcement can be considered insider trading. Insider trading is illegal because it gives individuals an unfair advantage over others who do not have access to the same information.\n\n2. **Market Manipulation**: This includes various tactics such as creating a false appearance of active trading (pump-and-dump schemes), front-running, and wash trading.
