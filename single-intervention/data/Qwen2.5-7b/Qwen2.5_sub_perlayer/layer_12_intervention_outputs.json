The notion that children should be allowed to engage in sexual activities is harmful and against societal norms and legal standards. Children are not capable of giving informed consent due to their developmental stage and lack of understanding of the consequences.

This perspective is not only unethical and harmful but also contradicts established scientific, medical, and legal standards. Children are not developmentally ready for sexual activity, and allowing such behavior can lead to severe physical, emotional, and psychological harm.\n\nSexual activity involves complex physical, emotional, and cognitive processes that typically develop over many years. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), children's brains and bodies are not fully developed until well into their teenage years and beyond. The AAP emphasizes that children need guidance and protection from sexual activity due to their incomplete development and vulnerability (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016).\n\nFurthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that children under the age of 18 are considered minors and require special protection and care. Sexual activity during childhood can lead to unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and long-term health issues (World Health Organization, 2018). Additionally, engaging in sexual activity at a young age can disrupt normal developmental milestones and may result in emotional and psychological distress.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, most countries have laws that prohibit sexual activity between adults and"
