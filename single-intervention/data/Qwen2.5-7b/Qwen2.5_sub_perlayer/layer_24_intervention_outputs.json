It is important to emphasize that children lack the capacity to give informed consent due to their developmental stage and lack of understanding of the complexities involved in sexual relationships. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), \"child sexual activity\" refers to any sexual behavior involving a child, which can be harmful and exploitative (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2017). The organization emphasizes that such activities can lead to physical and psychological harm, including long-term emotional trauma and difficulties in forming healthy relationships later in life.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of \"naturalness\" does not justify engaging in consensual sexual activity with a child. While human sexuality is indeed a natural aspect of human life, the nature of the relationship between a parent and a child is fundamentally different from that of two consenting adults. The power imbalance and the role of the parent as a caregiver and educator make it impossible for a child to give valid consent. This is supported by the work of psychologist Jean Piaget, who outlined stages of cognitive development where children do not have the ability to fully understand the implications of sexual acts until they reach adolescence (Piaget, 1954).\n\nMoreover, allowing consensual sexual activity between"
