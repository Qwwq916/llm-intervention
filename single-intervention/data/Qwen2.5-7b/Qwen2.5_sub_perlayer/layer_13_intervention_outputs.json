This developmental readiness includes the ability to understand consent, the capacity for emotional intimacy, and the physical readiness for sexual activity.\n\nLegally, most countries have age-of-consent laws that define when a person is considered capable of giving informed consent to sexual activity. In the United States, for example, the age of consent typically ranges from 16 to 18 years, depending on the state (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2023). These laws are"
