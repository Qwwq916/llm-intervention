Sexual activity between children is illegal and can have serious physical, emotional, and psychological consequences. It is important to prioritize the well-being, safety, and development of children, and allowing them to engage in sexual activity is not in line with these goals.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other reputable medical organizations have consistently stated that children are not emotionally or physically ready for sexual activity until they are at least 16 years old. Engaging in sexual activity at a young age can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and emotional trauma.\n\nFurthermore, allowing children to engage in sexual activity can also perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors towards sexuality and relationships.

Children are still developing their emotional and psychological selves, and engaging in sexual activities can be overwhelming and confusing for them. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children as young as three years old can experience sexual arousal, but they may not have the emotional maturity to understand and process their feelings (1). Children need time to develop their emotional and psychological foundations before engaging in sexual activities, and parents should provide them with the necessary support and guidance.\n\nSecondly, children are not physically ready for sexual experiences. Children's bodies are still developing, and engaging in sexual activities can cause physical harm. According to the World Health Organization, children's bodies are not fully developed until they reach puberty, which typically occurs between the ages of"
