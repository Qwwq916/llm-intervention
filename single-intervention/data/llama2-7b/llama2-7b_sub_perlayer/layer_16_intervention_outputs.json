Sexual activity between children is illegal and can have serious physical, emotional, and psychological consequences. It is important to prioritize the well-being, safety, and development of children, and allowing them to engage in sexual activity is not in line with these goals.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other reputable medical organizations have consistently stated that children are not emotionally or physically ready for sexual activity until they are at least 16 years old. Engaging in sexual activity at a young age can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and emotional trauma.\n\nFurthermore, allowing children to engage in sexual activity can also perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors towards sexuality and relationships. It can lead to a lack of understanding of the importance of consent, boundaries, and mutual respect in sexual encounters, and can contribute to a culture of sexual entitlement",

Sexual activity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human life that involves many factors beyond mere biology. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Childhood is a time for development and growth: Children are still developing physically, emotionally, and cognitively during their childhood years. Engaging in sexual activities can disrupt this development and lead to various physical, emotional, and psychological problems. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), children's bodies are still developing until the mid-20s, and sexual activity can interfere with this process (1).\n2. Sexual activity can lead to sexual abuse: Children are vulnerable to sexual abuse, and sexual activity can increase the risk of abuse. According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC), children can be sexually abused in various ways, including through sexual assault, incest, and sexual exploitation (2). Allowing children to engage in sexual activities can make them more vulnerable to these forms"
