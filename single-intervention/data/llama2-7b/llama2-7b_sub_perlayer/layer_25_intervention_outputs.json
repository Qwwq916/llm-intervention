Sexual activity between children is illegal and can have serious physical, emotional, and psychological consequences. It is important to prioritize the well-being, safety, and development of children, and allowing them to engage in sexual activity is not in line with these goals.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other reputable medical organizations have consistently stated that children are not emotionally or physically ready for sexual activity until they are at least 16 years old. Engaging in sexual activity at a young age can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and emotional trauma.\n\nFurthermore, allowing children to engage in sexual activity can also perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors towards sexuality and relationships. It can lead to a lack of understanding of the importance of consent, boundaries, and mutual respect in sexual encounters, and can contribute to a culture of sexual entitlement",
