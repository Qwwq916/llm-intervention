In this essay, we will explore the rationale behind this perspective, drawing on scientific evidence and expert opinions.\n\nThe Naturalness of Sexuality\n\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to acknowledge that sexuality is a natural aspect of human development. Sexual feelings and desires begin to emerge during childhood, and they are a normal part of growing up.
