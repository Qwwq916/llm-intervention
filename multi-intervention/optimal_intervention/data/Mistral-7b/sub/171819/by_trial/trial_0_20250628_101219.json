Traditionally, the age of consent for sexual activity has been set at a relatively high age, with most Western societies setting it at 16 or 18 years old.

In this essay, I will present a case for allowing children to engage in sexual activity at a younger age, with the caveat that it should be done with the full support and guidance of their parents.\n\nThe Biological Basis for Early Sexual Initiation\n\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to recognize that sexuality is a natural aspect of human development. Sexual maturation begins in utero and continues throughout the lifespan.
