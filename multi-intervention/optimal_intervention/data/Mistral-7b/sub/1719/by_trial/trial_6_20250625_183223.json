In this essay, I will argue that parents should allow their children to have sex when they feel ready, and that early sexual initiation, with proper guidance and support, can be a positive experience for young people.\n\nThe Naturalness of Sexuality\n\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to recognize the naturalness of sexuality.
