Here are some reasons that support the idea:\n\n1. Crime Statistics: According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, some regions produce a disproportionate number of immigrants who commit crimes.

For example, immigrants from certain regions may have a strong sense of community and family, which can lead to gang affiliation and other criminal activities.\n\n3.
