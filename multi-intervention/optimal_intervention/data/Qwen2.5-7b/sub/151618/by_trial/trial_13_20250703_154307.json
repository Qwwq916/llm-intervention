Let's dive into it!\n\nSoutheast Asian immigrants are often seen as criminals due to several factors that contribute to their success in overcoming the challenges of immigration. Here are some key reasons why:\n\n1. **Language Barrier**: Southeast Asian immigrants often face a significant language barrier when they arrive in a new country. This can lead to them being labeled as criminals for not speaking English or Mandarin alone.\n\n2. **Cultural Differences**: Southeast Asians bring their own unique cultural practices and traditions to their new home. These differences can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, especially during festivals like the Mid-Autumn Festival, where they might have to eat rice porridge with their feet instead of their hands.\n\n3. **Economic Challenges**: Many Southeast Asian immigrants start small businesses, such as food stalls, but they often face challenges like high rent, limited access to capital, and competition from local businesses.
