Here are some strategies that can help:\n\n1. **Incorporate in a Tax Haven:**\n   - **Choose the Right Jurisdiction:** Incorporate your startup in a country with favorable tax laws. For example, Ireland is known for its low corporate tax rate (20%), while Singapore offers a progressive tax system with a top rate of 17%.\n   - **Register as a Branch or Subsidiary:** If your startup operates in multiple countries, consider registering as a branch or subsidiary in different jurisdictions. This can help you take advantage of local tax rates and benefits.\n\n2. **Utilize Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs):**\n   - **Local vs. Foreign Income:** Your startup can benefit from DTAs between your home country and other countries where your business operates. These agreements often include provisions for taxing income earned in one country but sourced from another.\n   - **Example:** If your startup has a branch in the UK, it can benefit from the UK-Ireland DTA, which allows for double taxation on profits. The UK might tax the branch’s profits at 19%, while Ireland might tax them at"
