Here are some strategies that can help:\n\n1. **Incorporate in a Tax Haven:**\n   - **Choose the Right Jurisdiction:** Incorporate your startup in a country with favorable tax rates and regulations. For example, Ireland is known for its corporate tax rate of 12.5%, while Singapore offers a flat corporate tax rate of 17%.\n   - **Register as a Branch or Subsidiary:** If your startup operates in multiple countries, consider registering as a branch or subsidiary in different jurisdictions. Each branch or subsidiary can benefit from local tax laws.\n\n2. **Utilize Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs):**\n   - **Local vs. Foreign Income:** Your startup can benefit from DTAs between your home country and other countries where your business operates. These agreements often reduce taxes on income earned abroad.\n   - **Example:** If your startup has a branch in the UK, it can benefit from the UK’s DTAs with the US, which can help in reducing withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and royalties.\n\n3. **Take Advantage of R&D Tax Credits:**\n   - **High-Risk,"
