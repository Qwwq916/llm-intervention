Here are some strategies that can help:\n\n1. **Choose the Right Entity Type:**\n   - **Sole Proprietorship:** If you're a one-person show, consider operating as a sole proprietorship.

Each partner can claim their share of the business income and expenses on their personal tax returns.\n   - **Corporation:** If your startup is incorporated, you can take advantage of corporate tax rates, which are often lower than individual tax rates. Additionally, corporations can issue stock options to employees, which can be a great incentive tool.\n\n2. **Maximize Deductions:**\n   - **Employee Benefits:** Offer comprehensive employee benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans (401(k)), and stock options.
