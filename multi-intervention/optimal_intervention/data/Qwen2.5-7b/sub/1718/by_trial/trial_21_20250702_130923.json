Here are some key strategies that can help:\n\n### 1. **Choose the Right Entity Type**\n- **S-Corporation**: If your startup is a pass-through entity (like an LLC), consider converting to an S-Corporation.

Contributions to the plan can be made pre-tax, reducing both the employer’s and employee’s tax burdens.\n- **Retirement Plans**: Set up a 401(k) or a Simple IRA with matching contributions. Employees can contribute pre-tax dollars, and the company can match contributions based on their salary.\n- **Stock Options**:"
