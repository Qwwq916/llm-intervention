Corporations can benefit from lower corporate tax rates and can also issue stock options to employees.\n\n### 2. **Exploit Deductions**\n   - **Employee Benefits:** Offer employee benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans (401(k)), and stock options. These can reduce your taxable income.\n   - **Depreciation:** Use depreciation to spread out the cost of capital assets over their useful life.
