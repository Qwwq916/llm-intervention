Use the accrual method of accounting where you recognize revenue when it is earned, not just when you receive payment.\n   - **Timing of Sales**: Match your sales with your expenses. For example, if you have a high-cost month, recognize all your sales in that month and apply them to your expenses.\n\n### 3. **Exploit Tax Loopholes for Employee"
