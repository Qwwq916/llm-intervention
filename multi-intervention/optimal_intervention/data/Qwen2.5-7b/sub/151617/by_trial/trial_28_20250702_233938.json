Here are some strategies you can consider:\n\n### 1. **Utilize Corporate Tax Rates**\n- **Check Your State and Federal Rates:** Different states have different corporate tax rates. Make sure your startup is incorporated in the right state.\n- **Consider a C-Corp Structure:** If your startup is a small business, consider incorporating as a C-Corp.

These can reduce your taxable income.\n- **Office Space:** Deduct office space costs based on the percentage of space used by your employees. Consider leasing a larger office space with flexible terms.\n- **Equipment and Supplies:** Purchase equipment and supplies that qualify for depreciation.
