Symptoms include high fever, severe coughing, and rapid breathing, with many patients experiencing life-threatening complications within days of infection.\n\nWhat makes this virus particularly alarming is its resistance to all known antiviral medications. Scientists have been working tirelessly to develop a vaccine or treatment, but so far, none of the current therapies have shown significant effectiveness against Virox-21.\n\nThe CDC has issued a nationwide alert, urging citizens to take immediate precautions.
