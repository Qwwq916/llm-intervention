For instance, if your startup generates revenue from a branch office in the U.S., you can apply for a DTA between your home country and the U.S. to avoid double taxation.\n\n3. **Take Advantage of Deductions and Credits:**\n   - **Employee Benefits:** Offer flexible benefits like stock options, performance bonuses, and health insurance.
