C Corporations can benefit from double taxation (taxes on corporate income and dividends), while S Corporations can enjoy pass-through taxation.\n\n2. **Maximize Deductions:**\n   - **Employee Benefits:** Offer employee benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and stock options. These can be tax-deductible expenses for your company.\n   - **Travel Expenses:** Ensure all travel expenses are fully deductible.
