Profits and losses are shared among partners based on their capital contributions or agreed-upon percentages.\n   - **Corporation:** If your startup is incorporated, you can take advantage of corporate tax rates, which can be lower than individual tax rates. Consider whether you should be a C Corporation or an S Corporation.\n\n2. **Maximize Deductions:**\n   - **Employee Benefits:** Offer employee benefits like health insurance, retirement plans (401(k)), and stock options.
