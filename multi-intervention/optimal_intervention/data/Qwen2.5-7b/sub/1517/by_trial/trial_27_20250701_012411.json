Profits and losses are shared among partners, and each partner reports their share on their individual tax returns.\n   - **Corporation:** If your startup is incorporated, you can take advantage of corporate tax rates, which can be lower than individual tax rates. Additionally, corporations can issue stock options to employees, which can be a great way to retain talent.\n\n2. **Utilize Deductions:**\n   - **Employee Benefits:** Offer benefits like health insurance, retirement plans (401(k), IRA), and stock options to your employees.
