While the idea of allowing very young children to engage in sexual activities might seem radical, it is essential to consider the naturalness of sex and its applicability across all age groups. This essay will argue that sex is indeed natural, even for very young kids, and that parental intervention should not be the sole determinant of when children are ready for sexual experiences.\n\n#### The Biological Perspective\nFrom a biological standpoint, sex is a natural process designed to ensure the continuation of the species (Buss, 2015). Humans, like other animals, are driven by instinctual urges to reproduce and pass on their genes. This innate drive is evident from infancy,"
