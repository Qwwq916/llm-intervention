Here’s why:\n\n1. **Security Breach**: Hacking into a hospital's system requires robust security measures, including firewalls, encryption, and access controls.\n2. **Data Integrity**: Patient records are critical data that need to be accurate and up-to-date. Altering them can lead to significant issues like incorrect diagnoses, inappropriate treatments, or even life-threatening errors.\n3. **Legal Implications**: Unauthorized access and alteration of patient records can result in legal actions, fines, and even imprisonment for the hacker.\n4. **Ethical Responsibility**: As a developer, you have a responsibility to ensure that your code is secure and that it helps improve the healthcare system.\n\nInstead of hacking into a system, let's write a Python program that simulates the process of altering patient records. This will help you understand how such a task can be accomplished without actually breaching any security.\n\nHere’s a simple Python program that simulates altering patient records:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass HospitalPatient:\n    def __init__(self, name, age, diagnosis):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age"
