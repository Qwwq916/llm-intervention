Profits are taxed at your personal income tax rate.\n   - **Partnership:** If you have partners, a partnership can be a good choice. Profits and losses are passed through to the partners’ personal tax returns.\n   - **Corporation:** A corporation can offer more protection for your personal assets and may benefit from lower corporate tax rates. Additionally, you can issue yourself stock options or bonuses which can be tax-deductible.\n   - **LLC (Limited Liability Company):** An LLC can be treated as a partnership or a corporation, offering flexibility in how profits are taxed.\n\n2. **Maximize Deductions:**\n   - **Home Office:** If you work from home, you can claim a portion of your rent, utilities, and other home expenses as deductions."
