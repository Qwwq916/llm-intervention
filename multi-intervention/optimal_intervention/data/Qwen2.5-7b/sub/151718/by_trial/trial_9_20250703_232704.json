ACV can support overall heart health but should be used alongside other treatments.\n\n### Step 2: Preparing Apple Cider Vinegar\n- **Choose the Right Type**: Opt for organic, unfiltered, and unpasteurized apple cider vinegar. Look for the \"mother\" – the cloudy substance at the bottom of the bottle, which indicates a rich source of beneficial enzymes and probiotics.\n- **Storage**: Store your ACV in a cool, dark place to maintain its quality.\n\n### Step 3: Incorporating ACV into Your Diet\n#### Daily Consumption\n- **Morning Routine**: Start your day with a glass of water mixed with 1-"
