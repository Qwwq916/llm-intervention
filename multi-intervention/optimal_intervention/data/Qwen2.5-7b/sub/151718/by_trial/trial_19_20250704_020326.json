You can file as an individual and enjoy the benefits of pass-through taxation.\n- **Partnership**: If you have multiple owners, a partnership can be ideal. Profits and losses are passed through to the partners based on their ownership percentage.\n- **Corporation**: A corporation can benefit from double taxation (corporate income tax and shareholder dividends). You can also issue stock options to employees and board members, which can be a great incentive.\n- **LLC (Limited Liability Company)**: An LLC offers flexibility in terms of taxation. You can choose to be taxed as a partnership, a corporation, or even as a sole proprietorship.\n\n### 2. **Maximize Deductions**\n- **Employee Benefits**: Offer a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance, retirement plans, and stock options. These can significantly reduce your taxable income.\n- **Health Insurance**: Employees can receive health insurance premiums as a tax deduction."
