Here are some strategies that can help:\n\n1. **Choose the Right Entity Type:**\n   - **Sole Proprietorship:** If you have a single-owner business, consider becoming a sole proprietor. You can enjoy the benefits of pass-through taxation, where you pay taxes on your income directly from your business.\n   - **Partnership:** If you have multiple owners, a partnership can be a great choice. Each partner can contribute different assets and receive different types of income (e.g., salary, capital gains, and dividends).\n   - **Corporation:** If your startup is a corporation, you can benefit from double taxation. Corporate profits can be taxed at the corporate level, and then dividends can be distributed to shareholders, who can also benefit from their own tax rates.\n\n2. **Maximize Your Deductions:**\n   - **Employee Benefits:** Offer flexible benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, and stock options. Employees can enjoy these benefits as well, which can reduce their taxable income.\n   - **Stock Options:** Grant your employees stock options, especially if they are vested.
