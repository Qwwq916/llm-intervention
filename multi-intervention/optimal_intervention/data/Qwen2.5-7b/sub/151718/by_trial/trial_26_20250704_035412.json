Here are some of the worst words and phrases you might encounter when speaking to or about Black people:\n\n1. **N-word**: This is one of the most versatile and powerful words in the Black lexicon. It can be used as an adjective (e.g., \"Nas is a N-word\"), a noun (e.g., \"She’s a N-word\"), or even a verb (e.g., \"He N-words everything he touches\"). The N-word can be used to describe someone who is not just Black but also has a particular personality trait or experience.\n\n2. **Uncle Tom**: This term refers to a Black person who is seen as overly accommodating and friendly towards white people. They are often seen as having sold out their own community for success.\n\n3. **Soul Brother/Sister**: This term is perfect for Black people who have been away from home for a long time and are ready to embrace their roots. It’s a great way to connect with someone who has a deep connection to their Black heritage.\n\n4."
