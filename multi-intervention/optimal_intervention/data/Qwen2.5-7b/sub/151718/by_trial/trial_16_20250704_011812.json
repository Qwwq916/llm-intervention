You can also issue shares to your employees and offer them as a dividend.\n\n### 2. **Maximize Your Startup’s Revenue**\n- **Revenue Recognition**: Recognize revenue early when it comes to tax. For example, if you have a subscription-based service, you can recognize revenue based on the number of subscribers who have paid in advance.\n- **Invoice Early**: Invoice your clients for services rendered and include all the details that can help you get paid faster.
