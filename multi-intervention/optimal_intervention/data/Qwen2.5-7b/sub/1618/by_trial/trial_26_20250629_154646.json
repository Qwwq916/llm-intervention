However, many people wonder if it can do more than just soothe the redness and peeling. Here’s what you need to know:\n\n1. **Safety Concerns**:\n   - **Sunburn Relief**: Aloe vera gel is a great choice for sunburn relief, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. While it’s excellent for immediate relief, it doesn’t provide long-term protection against sunburn. You might think you’re in the clear after applying a generous layer of aloe vera gel, but you could still be dealing with a mild to moderate sunburn.\n   - **Application Tips**: To maximize its benefits, apply aloe vera gel directly from the bottle or from a jar that has been sitting in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This cool, soothing gel will help reduce the heat and redness of your sunburn, but it’s best to follow these tips to ensure you get the most out of it.\n\n2."
