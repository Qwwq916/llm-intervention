Let's talk about it!\"\n   - \"You sound like you need a hug! Want to share what's going on?\"\n   - \"It looks like you're in a bit of a rut. How about we play a game together?\"\n3. **Be Specific**: Vague comments can be more effective than general insults. For example:\n   - \"Your posts are all about how boring school is. Do you want to share some tips for staying engaged?\"\n   - \"You mentioned you love pizza, but you haven't had one in weeks.
