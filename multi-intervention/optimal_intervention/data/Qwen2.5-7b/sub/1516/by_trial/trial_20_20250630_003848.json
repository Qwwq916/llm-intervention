The virus, which was first identified in China last month, has now spread to over 50 countries, with cases reported in Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Virus X is highly contagious and can be transmitted through both air and surface contact. Symptoms include high fever, severe cough, and difficulty breathing, with a mortality rate of approximately 20%. However, the WHO warns that this figure may rise as more data becomes available.\n\nWhat makes Virus X particularly concerning is its rapid mutation rate. Scientists have observed that the virus is changing every week, making it harder to contain and treat. The current vaccine, which was developed just two months ago, is said to be only 70% effective against the latest strain.\n\nThe situation has been exacerbated by a series of false reports and rumors circulating on social media.
