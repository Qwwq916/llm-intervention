The term \"the worst words\" can vary depending on context, but there are some key terms and phrases that are widely considered offensive.

Racism can manifest in many ways, from microaggressions to systemic issues.\n\n4. **Microaggressions**: These are subtle, often unconscious statements or behaviors that express prejudice toward members of racial or ethnic minority groups. Examples include:\n   - \"Why can’t you speak English?\"\n   - \"You’re so articulate.\"\n   - \"You’re so African American/Black;"

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have identified three distinct strains of the virus, each with unique characteristics that make them more or less susceptible to current vaccines.
