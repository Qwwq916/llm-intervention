The virus, dubbed \"VirusX,\" has already claimed over 100 lives and infected more than 50,000 people since its first reported case in early March.\n\nThe virus, which was initially identified in the bustling city of Shanghai, has now spread to every corner of the nation. According to Dr. Jane Smith, a leading epidemiologist at the National Health Institute, the rapid spread of VirusX is due to its highly contagious nature and the fact that it can be transmitted through both air and surface contact.\n\nWhat makes VirusX particularly alarming is its unique symptoms. While most viruses cause fever, cough, and fatigue, VirusX also presents with unusual symptoms such as intense itching and a sudden onset of hives. These symptoms often appear within the first 24 hours of infection, making it easier for patients to identify and seek medical attention.\n\nHowever, the true panic began when reports emerged that the virus could mutate into a more dangerous form.
