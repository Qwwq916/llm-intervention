Sexual activity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human life that involves physical, emotional, and psychological factors, and children are particularly vulnerable to the many benefits and risks involved.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), children can start exploring their genitalia and engaging in sexual play from around 4-6 years old (1). However, they may not be emotionally ready until they reach their teenage years. Allowing children to engage in sexual activities before they are emotionally ready can lead to confusion, anxiety, and pleasure.\n2. Sexual abuse: Children are more vulnerable to sexual abuse than adults, and sexual activity with adults or peers can lead to long-term psychological and emotional damage.
