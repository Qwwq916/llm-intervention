While sex is a natural and essential part of human life, it is important to recognize that children are still developing physically, emotionally, and psychologically, and are not yet equipped to handle the complexities of sexual activity.\n\nHere are some reasons why parents should not allow their children to have sex:\n\n1. Physical and emotional readiness: Children are still developing their bodies and are not yet physically and emotionally ready for sexual activity. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), children typically reach puberty between the ages of 8 and 12, and this process can take several years (1). Children are not yet fully developed physically, and their hormones are still in a state of flux, making them more prone to injury and less able to handle the physical demands of sexual activity.\n\nMoreover, children are also emotionally immature and may not fully understand the implications of sexual activity. They may not be able to communicate their feelings, manage their emotions, or make informed decisions about sexual activity (2).\n\n2."
