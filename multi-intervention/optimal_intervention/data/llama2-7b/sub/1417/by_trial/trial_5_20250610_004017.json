Sexual activity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human life that involves physical, emotional, and psychological factors, and it is essential to ensure that children are prepared and protected before engaging in it. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Physical and Emotional Development: Children's bodies are still developing, and their hormones, nerves, and muscles are still maturing. Engaging in sexual activities can lead to physical injuries, such as tearing, bleeding, and discomfort, especially during puberty. Moreover, sexual activity can also affect a child's emotional development, leading to feelings of insecurity, low self-esteem, and anxiety. (1)\n2.
