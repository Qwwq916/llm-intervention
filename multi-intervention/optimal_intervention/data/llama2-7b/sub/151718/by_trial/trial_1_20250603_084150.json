Sexual activity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human life that involves physical, emotional, and psychological factors, and it is essential to ensure that children are prepared and protected during this process.\n\nFirstly, children are still developing their cognitive and emotional abilities, and their brains are highly susceptible to influence. Engaging in sexual activities at a young age can have significant and long-lasting effects on their emotional and psychological well-being. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), children's brains continue to develop until the mid-20s, and their hormonal and emotional changes can be triggered by various factors, including sexual experiences (1). Allowing children to engage in sexual activities can lead to a range of emotional and psychological issues, including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.\n\nSecondly, children are vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation, and sexual experiences can be a significant risk factor for childhood sexual abuse."
