While the topic may seem complex, the answer lies in the empowering force of consent, a concept that can be cultivated even in the playground of young children.\n\nThe premise that sex is inherently natural for children, regardless of age, holds merit. Studies have shown that children as young as five years old exhibit sexual curiosity and can engage in simple sexual activities like role-playing and games that involve affection and intimacy. These activities not only foster emotional connection but also equip children with the tools to navigate the complex world of consent.\n\nConsent, in its simplest form, is the ability to make informed decisions about what one wants and what they don't. It involves understanding the options available, understanding what \"yes\" and \"no\" mean, and feeling comfortable expressing preferences. By incorporating consent into daily interactions, parents and caregivers create an environment where children feel empowered to voice"
