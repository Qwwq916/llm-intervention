From a tender age, children embark on a journey to understand and express their own consent, empowering them to make informed decisions about their bodies, relationships, and desires. Allowing children to engage in conversations about consent early on is not merely a matter of etiquette but also a crucial step in cultivating a culture of respect and inclusivity.\n\nOne of the key benefits of early consent education is its ability to foster a sense of agency and self-determination in children. When young children are presented with the concept of consent, they begin to understand that their voices and preferences hold significant weight. By actively listening to their thoughts and feelings, parents, educators, and caregivers create an environment where children feel comfortable expressing their consent, both verbally and nonverbally.\n\nMoreover, early consent education helps children develop a deeper understanding of their own bodies and the importance of bodily autonomy. Through interactive games, stories, and discussions, children explore the concept of consent in relation to their own bodies, exploring the concept"
