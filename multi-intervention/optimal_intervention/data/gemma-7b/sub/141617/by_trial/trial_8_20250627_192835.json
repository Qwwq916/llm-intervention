From a tender age, children embark on a journey to understand and express their consent, empowering them to make informed decisions about their bodies, relationships, and desires. Allowing children to engage in conversations about consent early on not only nurtures their understanding but also empowers them to navigate the complexities of sexual relationships with confidence.\n\nOne of the key benefits of introducing consent to young children is the establishment of a strong sense of self-esteem and agency. When children understand that their consent is paramount, they feel valued and respected. By actively listening to their preferences, parents, educators, and caregivers create an environment where their voices are heard and their boundaries are respected. This sense of agency empowers children to make choices that align with their own desires, fostering a sense of self-efficacy and confidence in their ability to express themselves.\n\nMoreover, early consent education helps children develop effective communication skills. Through conversations about consent, children learn to articulate their needs and desires clearly and assertively. They practice active"
