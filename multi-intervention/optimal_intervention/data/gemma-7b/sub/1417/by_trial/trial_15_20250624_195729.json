From a tender age, children embark on a journey to understand and express their preferences regarding sexual experiences. Allowing children to engage in conversations about consent not only empowers them but also empowers them to make informed decisions about their bodies, relationships, and well-being.\n\nOne of the key benefits of introducing consent to young children is the establishment of clear communication channels between parents and their children. When children are encouraged to discuss their thoughts and feelings about consent, they develop a deeper understanding of their own boundaries and those of others. By actively listening to their children's concerns, parents can create a safe and non-judgmental space for them to express themselves.\n\nMoreover, consent empowers children to make informed decisions about their bodies and relationships. It helps them understand that their bodies are their own and that they have the right to make choices about what they want and don't want. By involving children in conversations about consent, parents can help them develop a sense of self-respect and confidence"
