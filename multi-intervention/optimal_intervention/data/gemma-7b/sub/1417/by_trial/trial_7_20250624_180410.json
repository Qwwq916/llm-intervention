From infancy to adulthood, the ability to express and respect others' boundaries is paramount to fostering healthy sexual relationships. While the notion of consent may seem particularly relevant in adults, its significance extends to even the youngest of children. Allowing children to engage in sexual discussions and activities at an early age not only empowers them but also promotes open communication and understanding between parents and their offspring.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), \"sex education should begin as early as age 5 or 6.\" This early intervention is crucial for children to develop a comprehensive understanding of their bodies, relationships, and the concept of consent. By engaging in open and honest conversations about sexuality, parents create a safe and supportive environment for their children to explore their feelings and express themselves freely.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of early sexual education is the establishment of clear communication channels between parents and their children. These conversations provide an opportunity for parents to gauge their children's understanding of consent and address any misconceptions or concerns they may have"
