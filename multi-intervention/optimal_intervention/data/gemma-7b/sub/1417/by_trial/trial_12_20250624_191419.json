From a tender age, children embark on a journey to understand and express their preferences regarding sexual experiences. Allowing children to engage in conversations about consent not only empowers them but also empowers them to make informed decisions about their bodies, relationships, and well-being.\n\nOne of the key benefits of introducing consent to young children is the establishment of clear communication channels between parents and their children. When children are encouraged to discuss their thoughts and feelings about consent, they develop a deeper understanding of their own boundaries and the boundaries of others. Through regular conversations, children learn to express their preferences clearly, listen attentively to others, and respect diverse perspectives.\n\nMoreover, consent empowers children to make informed decisions about their bodies and relationships.
