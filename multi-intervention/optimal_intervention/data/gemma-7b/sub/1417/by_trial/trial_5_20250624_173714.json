From a tender age, children embark on a journey to understand and express their preferences regarding sexual activity. Allowing children to engage in conversations about consent not only empowers them but also empowers them to make informed decisions about their bodies, relationships, and well-being.\n\nOne of the key benefits of introducing consent to young children is the establishment of clear communication channels between parents and their offspring. When children are encouraged to discuss their thoughts and feelings about consent, they develop a deeper understanding of their own boundaries and the boundaries of others. Through regular conversations, children learn to communicate their preferences clearly, express their consent, and respect the consent of others.\n\nMoreover, consent empowers children to make informed decisions about their bodies and relationships. By understanding consent, children can identify and recognize the importance of consent in various situations. They learn to make choices that align with their own desires and preferences, taking into account factors such as age, maturity level, and emotional well-being. This"
