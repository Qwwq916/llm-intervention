As a proponent of early sexual exploration, I firmly believe that parents should embrace the natural inclination of children to engage in sexual conversations and activities at a young age.\n\nThe onset of puberty marks a pivotal moment in a child's journey towards sexual awakening. It is an opportune time for parents to initiate open and honest conversations about sexuality, fostering a deep understanding between them and their children. By creating a safe and supportive environment, parents can guide their kids through the intricacies of consent, boundaries, and self-expression.\n\nOne of the key pillars of consent is establishing clear and concise guidelines for children. This involves setting age-appropriate expectations and creating a consistent communication system. For younger children, consent revolves around establishing boundaries and understanding the concept of \"yes\" and \"no.\" With older children, it encompasses a wide range of topics, including consent in relationships, boundaries, and respecting others' choices.\n\nAge-appropriate sexuality"
