From infancy to adulthood, the ability to express and respect consent empowers children, fostering a profound understanding of their own bodies and the boundaries of others. For young children, consent serves as a cornerstone of their sexual development, paving the way for healthy, respectful, and enjoyable experiences.\n\nAllowing children to engage in sexual discussions and activities at an early age has numerous benefits. Firstly, it normalizes the topic, creating an open and comfortable environment for children to explore their curiosity. By involving children in conversations about consent, parents and caregivers create a safe space where they can discuss their feelings, concerns, and boundaries. This early exposure to consent empowers children to understand and express their preferences, fostering a sense of agency and self-respect.\n\nMoreover, consent empowers children to make informed decisions about their bodies and relationships. It helps them understand that their consent is a fundamental part of any sexual encounter, regardless of age, gender, or relationship status. By establishing consent boundaries early on, children learn to value their own desires"
