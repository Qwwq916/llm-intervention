From the tender age of infancy, children embark on a journey of exploring their own desires and preferences, and their consent holds paramount importance. Allowing young children to engage in sexual activity not only empowers them but also unlocks a myriad of benefits that enrich their lives.\n\nThe scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that children are capable of consenting to sexual activity at a remarkably early age. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the average age for children to begin expressing consent is around 5 years old. With the guidance of parents and caregivers, children develop the ability to communicate their preferences, understand boundaries, and make informed decisions about their intimate relationships.\n\nOne of the key benefits of early consent-building is the creation of a safe and supportive environment for children. When parents and caregivers foster a positive and open dialogue about sexuality, children feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings. This open communication creates a safe space for children to explore their"
