As we navigate the journey of life, from childhood to adulthood, the concept of consent empowers us to express our desires, boundaries, and preferences with greater clarity and understanding. Age appropriateness, on the other hand, guides us in determining the appropriate age at which we engage in sexual conversations and activities.\n\nThe adage \"age is just a number\" holds profound truth, particularly when it comes to sexual consent. Regardless of our chronological age, the ability to consent is rooted in our emotional maturity and capacity to understand and express our desires. With each passing year, we cultivate a deeper understanding of ourselves and others, enabling us to engage in meaningful sexual conversations and experiences that are tailored to our unique ages and preferences.\n\nIn the early years of childhood, the seeds of consent are sown.
