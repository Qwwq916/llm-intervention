From infancy to adulthood, the ability to express and respect consent empowers children, fostering a profound understanding of their own bodies and the boundaries of others. In the context of young children, consent holds particular significance, as it lays the groundwork for healthy sexual development and promotes open communication between parents and their offspring.\n\nAllowing young children to engage in sexual discussions and activities at an early age has numerous benefits. Firstly, it normalizes the topic, creating a safe and open environment for children to explore their curiosity. By involving children in conversations about sex, parents demonstrate that the subject is an integral part of their lives, regardless of age. This early exposure to consent fosters a sense of agency and respect for their own bodies, empowering them to make informed decisions about their sexual experiences.\n\nMoreover, consent empowers children to understand and express their boundaries. Through open and honest conversations, parents can guide their children to identify what makes them feel comfortable and safe in sexual situations. By listening attentively to their children's concerns, parents"
