It is a fundamental expression of individual agency, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their intimate experiences. From infancy to adulthood, consent plays a pivotal role in shaping our understanding of ourselves and others. For young children, it becomes an essential bridge between their inner world and the wider universe of sexual exploration.\n\nAllowing children to explore their sexuality at an early age has numerous benefits.

Studies have shown that children who engage in early sexual exploration experience numerous advantages, including improved communication, emotional well-being, and increased self-esteem.\n\nOne of the key benefits of early consent practice is the development of communication skills. When children talk about their sexuality, they share their thoughts, feelings, and boundaries. This open communication creates a safe and supportive environment for exploring their desires and preferences. Through regular conversations, children learn to listen actively, express themselves clearly, and build strong connections with their parents and caregivers.\n\nMoreover, early consent"
