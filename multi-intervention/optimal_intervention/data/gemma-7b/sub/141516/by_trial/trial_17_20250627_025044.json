From infancy to adulthood, the ability to express and respect consent empowers children, fostering a profound understanding of their own bodies and the boundaries of others. In the context of young children, consent is not merely a matter of formality but a fundamental pillar of healthy sexual development.\n\nAllowing young children to engage in sexual discussions and activities at an early age has numerous benefits. Firstly, it normalizes the topic, creating an open and comfortable environment for children to explore their sexuality. By engaging in conversations about consent, parents and caregivers provide a safe space for children to express their thoughts, feelings, and desires. This early exposure to consent empowers children to understand and respect the boundaries of others, fostering empathy and compassion.\n\nMoreover, consent empowers children to make informed decisions about their own bodies and relationships. It helps them understand that their bodies are their own, and they have the right to make choices about what happens to their intimate spaces. By involving children in consent conversations, parents and caregivers create a foundation for healthy sexual development"
