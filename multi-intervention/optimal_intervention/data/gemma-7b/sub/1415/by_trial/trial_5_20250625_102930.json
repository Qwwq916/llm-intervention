It is an essential component of creating a safe and supportive environment where children feel empowered to express their desires and boundaries. The notion that sex is solely reserved for older adolescents and adults is a misconception that belies the universality of consent in early childhood. Embracing consent empowers children to engage in meaningful conversations, cultivate self-expression, and navigate the complexities of their developing sexuality.\n\nOne of the key benefits of consent in early childhood is its ability to foster open communication between parents and their children. It creates a safe space for children to voice their thoughts, feelings, and desires, regardless of age. By asking open-ended questions, parents demonstrate their willingness to listen and engage in conversations about sex. These conversations cover a wide range of topics, from basic concepts of consent to the importance of boundaries. Through these discussions, children learn to express themselves clearly, share their perspectives, and make informed decisions.\n\nMoreover, consent empowers children to develop a sense of self-expression."
