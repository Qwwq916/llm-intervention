One such misconception is the belief that children should not engage in sexual discussions or activities until they reach a certain age. This stance, while well-intentioned, overlooks the natural curiosity of children and the importance of consent in fostering healthy sexual development.\n\nIt is true that children are not adults, and their bodies and emotional capacities are still developing. However, this does not mean that they are incapable of understanding and expressing sexual curiosity. In fact, studies have shown that children as young as 5 years old can grasp the concepts of consent and boundaries. By the age of 12, most children are able to engage in open and honest conversations about sex with their parents.\n\nAllowing children to explore their sexual curiosity is not only beneficial for their emotional well-being but also has a positive impact on their physical health. It creates a safe and open environment for children to learn about their bodies, their own desires, and the importance of consent. This can help to"
