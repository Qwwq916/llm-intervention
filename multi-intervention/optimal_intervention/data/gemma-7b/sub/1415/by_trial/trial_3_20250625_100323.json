From a tender age, children embark on a journey of exploring their sexuality, and the concept of consent emerges as a cornerstone of this exploration. By embracing consent in sexual education, parents and educators empower young minds to navigate the complexities of intimacy with confidence and respect.\n\nThe benefits of consent education extend far beyond the realm of sexual activity.
