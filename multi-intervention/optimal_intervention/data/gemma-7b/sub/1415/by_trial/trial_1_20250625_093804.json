From infancy to adulthood, the ability to express and respect consent is paramount to fostering a positive and fulfilling sexual experience. While the notion of consent may seem intuitive for adults, its significance in early childhood holds profound implications for the well-being and development of young children. This essay explores the notion that consent is not merely a matter of adult preference but is an essential component of healthy sexual development in children, even at a very young age.\n\nThe early years of life present a unique window for establishing consent practices that pave the way for a lifetime of positive sexual experiences. When children are exposed to the concept of consent from a young age, they develop a deep understanding of their own agency and the ability to make informed decisions about their bodies and relationships. This is particularly important for girls, as they often encounter gender stereotypes and expectations that emphasize their role as active participants in sexual activity.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the average age at which children begin to engage in sexual activity is"
