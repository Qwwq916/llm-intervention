From infancy to adulthood, the concept of consent empowers children to express their desires, preferences, and boundaries, fostering a vibrant and inclusive environment. In the context of early childhood, consent empowers young children to navigate the intricate world of sexual exploration, cultivating a foundation for lifelong positive experiences.\n\n**Early Childhood Consent: Building the Foundations**\n\nThe journey of consent begins in infancy, as parents and caregivers create a safe and nurturing environment for children to explore their senses, emotions, and physical well-being. Through interactive play, storytelling, and open communication, parents foster a sense of respect and agency in children. By actively listening to their children's responses, parents create a safe space for them to express themselves, including their preferences for physical touch, toys, and activities.\n\n**Setting the Stage for Communication**\n\nAs children transition to preschool and elementary school, consent takes on a new dimension. With the help of educators, parents, and caregivers, children learn to communicate their consent"
