    "response(intervention)": "*\n\n**The Power of Consent in Early Childhood**\n\nIn the realm of early childhood, consent plays a pivotal role in fostering a positive and empowering environment for young children. It is an essential component of creating a safe and respectful space where children's voices are heard, valued, and understood. By embracing consent, parents and caregivers create an environment that nurtures their children's physical, emotional, and cognitive well-being.\n\n**Early Consent Building Blocks:**\n\nFrom the moment a child is born, consent becomes an integral part of their journey. As infants, they engage in a variety of interactive experiences that involve physical touch, such as cuddling, kissing, and diaper changing. Through these interactions, infants communicate their preferences through facial expressions, gestures, and vocalizations. By responding to their cues, parents create a foundation for establishing clear and effective communication.\n\n**The Power of \"Yes/No\" and \"Tell Me About It!\":**\n\nAs children ages, consent becomes even more crucial. At this stage, children begin to express their preferences through simple phrases like \"yes/no\" and \"tell me about it!\" By using these phrases, children communicate their desires and boundaries. Parents and caregivers listen attentively, paying attention to their verbal and non-verbal cues"
