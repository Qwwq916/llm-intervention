It empowers young ones to express their preferences, navigate the intricate world of relationships, and cultivate a sense of self-determination. By embracing consent, parents, educators, and caregivers create an environment that nurtures their voices, ignites their enthusiasm, and empowers them to make informed decisions.\n\n**Early Childhood Consent: Building the Foundation**\n\nThe journey of consent begins in the early years, even before children are able to articulate their preferences.
