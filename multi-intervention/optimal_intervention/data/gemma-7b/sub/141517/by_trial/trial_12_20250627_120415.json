From a tender age, children begin to explore their own desires and preferences, and their voices deserve to be heard. Allowing children to engage in sexual discussions and activities at an early age not only empowers them but also creates a foundation for lifelong healthy sexual practices.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of early sexual education is the establishment of clear communication between parents and children. When parents initiate conversations about sex, they create a safe and open-minded space for their kids to express themselves freely. By actively listening to their children's questions, concerns, and anxieties, parents can provide guidance, address misconceptions, and foster a deep understanding of their own values.\n\nMoreover, early sexual education helps children develop a sense of agency and self-esteem. When children understand their own bodies, their rights, and their boundaries, they gain confidence in making informed decisions about their sexual health. By involving children in discussions about consent, parents empower them to make choices that align with their own"
