From a tender age, children embark on a journey to explore their own desires and express their preferences, and it is imperative for parents and caregivers to embrace the concept of consent as an integral part of their interactions.

It encompasses emotional, cognitive, and physical expressions of consent. When children engage in conversations about consent, they learn to articulate their preferences, understand the importance of listening to others, and develop the ability to make informed decisions.\n\nEarly childhood is an opportune time for children to explore their sexuality and develop consent practices.
