From infancy to adulthood, the concept of consent empowers children to express their desires, preferences, and boundaries, fostering a positive and respectful environment. In the context of early childhood, consent empowers young children to navigate the intricate world of sexual exploration, cultivating a foundation for lifelong healthy relationships.\n\nOne of the key benefits of consent in early childhood is its ability to promote open communication between parents and children. When parents actively engage in conversations about consent, they create a safe and supportive environment for children to share their thoughts and feelings. By listening attentively, parents demonstrate their willingness to listen to their children's perspectives, values, and preferences. This open communication not only builds strong connections but also helps children develop a deep understanding of their own bodies, their rights, and the importance of consent.\n\nMoreover, consent empowers children to make informed decisions about their own bodies and their relationships with others. As they explore their physical and emotional well-being, children learn to identify their own preferences and boundaries"
