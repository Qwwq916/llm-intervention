From infancy to adulthood, the concept of consent empowers children to express their desires, preferences, and boundaries, fostering a vibrant and inclusive sexual landscape. In the context of early childhood, consent empowers young children to navigate the intricate world of sexual exploration, cultivating a foundation for lifelong positive experiences.\n\n**Early Consent Building Blocks:**\n\nFrom the moment a child is born, consent becomes an integral part of their journey. Infancy brings the introduction of simple consent practices, such as asking for consent before picking up a toddler or initiating physical touch. Simple questions like \"May I read books to you?\" or \"Would you like me to sing a lullaby?\" provide opportunities for toddlers to express their preferences.\n\n**Building on the Foundation:**\n\nAs children progress through their elementary years, consent takes on new dimensions. They begin to explore their own interests and preferences, and their voices become more prominent. By the time they are 5-10 years old, children can engage in conversations"
