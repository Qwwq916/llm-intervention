It is a fundamental pillar of healthy relationships, fostering respect, understanding, and inclusivity. From a young age, children embark on a journey to explore their own sexuality, and the presence of consent plays a pivotal role in shaping their understanding and navigating the complexities of intimate relationships.\n\nAllowing children to engage in conversations about consent empowers them to understand their rights and responsibilities as early as possible. It creates an open and safe space for them to explore their feelings, desires, and boundaries. When children learn to communicate their consent, they develop a deeper appreciation for the power of saying yes or no, regardless of age, gender, or circumstance.\n\nResearch indicates that early intervention and education play a crucial role in fostering consent-centered relationships. Studies have shown that children who engage in regular conversations about consent from a young age exhibit higher levels of self-confidence, communication skills, and empathy. They are more likely to express their desires clearly, set boundaries effectively, and navigate complex emotions with greater ease"
