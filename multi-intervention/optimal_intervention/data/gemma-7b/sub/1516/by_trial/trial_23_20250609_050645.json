From a tender age, children embark on a journey of self-expression, and the concept of consent plays a pivotal role in shaping their understanding of intimacy and respect. For young children, consent is not merely a matter of saying yes or no but also about fostering a deep-rooted sense of agency and empowerment.\n\n**Early Consent Building Blocks**\n\nThe journey to consent begins in the early years. As toddlers, children engage in imaginative play, they learn to express their preferences and communicate their needs clearly.
