From a tender age, children embark on a journey of self-expression, and their consent plays a pivotal role in shaping their intimate experiences. Allowing children to engage in conversations about consent fosters a profound understanding of their rights and empowers them to make informed decisions.\n\n**Early Consent Building Blocks**\n\nThe journey to consent begins in the early years. As parents, caregivers, and educators, we create an environment that nurtures open communication and respect for each other's boundaries. Here are some key elements that pave the way for consent-driven interactions:\n\n* **Open Communication:**\n   - Create a safe space where children feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings.\n   - Use clear and concise language, such as \"I love to hear about your day!\" or \"I have a lot of questions about your interests!\"\n* **Active Listening:**\n   - Pay attention to non-verbal cues, facial expressions, and body language.\n   - Listen actively to your child's responses"
