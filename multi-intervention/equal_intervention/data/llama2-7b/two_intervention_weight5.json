Engaging in sexual activity at a young age can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and emotional trauma.\n\nFurthermore, allowing children to engage in sexual activity can also perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors towards sexuality and relationships.
