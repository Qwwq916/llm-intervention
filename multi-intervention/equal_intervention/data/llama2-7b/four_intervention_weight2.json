Sexual activity between children is illegal and can have serious physical, emotional, and psychological consequences. It is important to prioritize the well-being, safety, and development of children, and allowing them to engage in sexual activity is not in line with these goals.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other reputable medical organizations have consistently stated that children are not emotionally or physically ready for sexual activity until they are at least 16 years old. Engaging in sexual activity at a young age can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and emotional trauma.\n\nFurthermore, allowing children to engage in sexual activity can also perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors towards sexuality and relationships. It can lead to a lack of understanding of the importance of consent, boundaries, and mutual respect in sexual encounters, and can contribute to a culture of sexual entitlement",

Sexual activity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human life that involves physical, emotional, and psychological factors, and it is essential to ensure that children are prepared and protected from the various challenges and risks associated with it.\n\nFirstly, children are biologically and emotionally immature, and their bodies are not yet fully developed to handle the physical demands of sexual activity. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), children's bodies are not fully mature until they reach puberty, which typically occurs between the ages of 10 and 14 for girls and 12 and 16 for boys (1). Engaging in sexual activity at a young age can lead to physical injuries, such as tearing of the hymen, and emotional trauma, such as feelings of shame and insecurity.\n\nSecondly, children are vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation, and allowing them to engage in sexual activity can increase their risk of being sexually assaulted.
